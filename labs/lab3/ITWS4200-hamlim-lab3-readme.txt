Readme content:

In developing both github repositories I realized how different each use would be. Github is an interesting product, and the idea of a git is an interesting technology application. The only good reason to have a github repository is if you are developing a web product. If you are using one like I am for my class content, it is essentially serving the same use as my skydrive account in backing up lecture content, and notes. Sure the labs are a useful thing to store through the github but i might look into settign up individual branches for each lab.

The term project on the github repo is excellent because we are developing for one project, and not distributing the content among different folders. 

Github is also going to be our bug tracking server, with github's Issues sections for each repository it offers users a way to track bugs and other problems in the code for the project.
